This project will utilize my current knowledge on HTML and CSS, as well as my as so far limited DevTool knowledge to recreate the Google homepage. 

By the end of this project, I should have a better grasp for both HTML and CSS, allowing me greater ease in future projects, as well as for DevTools and their extensive uses in the web development world.
